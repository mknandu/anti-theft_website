# Theft Detection Website Repository

Welcome to the Theft Detection Website repository! This project is a part of an engineering final year project aimed at developing a system for detecting theft using camera feeds.

## Project Overview:

Theft Detection Website is a web-based application designed to monitor camera feeds and detect suspicious activities indicative of theft. The system employs computer vision and machine learning algorithms to analyze live camera footage in real-time, identifying potential theft incidents and triggering appropriate alerts.

## Files Included:

1. **index.html**: The main HTML file for the website.
2. **style.css**: The CSS file for styling the website.
3. **main.js**: The JavaScript file for implementing theft detection algorithms and enhancing website functionality.
4. **live.html**: This file contains live updates from the camera feed, displaying real-time footage.
5. **picture.jpg**: An image file used in the website interface.

## Usage:

- **Accessing the Website**: Open `index.html` in a web browser to access the main interface of the website.
- **Monitoring Live Feed**: Navigate to `live.html` to view live camera footage and monitor for potential theft incidents.
- **Customization**: Modify `style.css` and `main.js` to customize the website's appearance and functionality as needed.
- **Integration**: Integrate the theft detection algorithms into `main.js` to enhance the system's detection capabilities.

## Installation and Deployment:
